## Prerequisites

Before running the application, ensure you have the following installed:

*   [Java 17 JDK](https://adoptium.net/) (or a compatible OpenJDK distribution)
*   Maven 3.8+ (optional, the project includes `./mvnw`)

## How to Run

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/abhishake2323/GamerSupplies.git
    cd GamerSupplies
    ```

2.  **Run the application (Development Mode):**
    The application defaults to an **H2 in-memory database**. This means you do not need to install or configure an external database server to test the application locally. Data will reset upon restart.
    
    If `spring-boot:run` fails in your environment, package and run the fat JAR directly:
    ```bash
    mvn clean package -DskipTests
    java -jar target\gamersupplies-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
    ```

3.  **Access the application:**
    *   Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080`.
    *   You can access the H2 DB console at `http://localhost:8080/h2-console` (JDBC URL: `jdbc:h2:mem:gamersuppliesdb`, un/pw: `sa` / `password`).

## Running Tests

The application includes a comprehensive JUnit 5 test suite validating models, MVC controllers, service logic, and database repositories. Run the suite using:
```bash
mvn test
```
