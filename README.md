# GamerSupplies

> **Project by Star Mode Studios**

GamerSupplies is a comprehensive E-Commerce Platform dedicated to gaming retail. It is designed to manage inventory, track stock across multiple distribution centers, and provide a seamless customer ordering experience.

## Technology Stack

*   **Backend:** Java 17, Spring Boot 3.4.2
*   **Database:** H2 (In-Memory Development) / PostgreSQL (Production ready)
*   **Frontend:** Thymeleaf (with custom Glassmorphism UI)
*   **Security:** Spring Security (BCrypt Password Encoding)
*   **Build Tool:** Maven

## Features
*   **Public Storefront:** Open access for guests to view the complete catalog of products and categories.
*   **Product Management & Administration:**
    *   **Staff Capabilities:** Authorized staff members (`ROLE_STAFF`) can add new products to the catalog.
    *   **Admin Dashboard:** A dedicated management panel for administrators (`ROLE_ADMIN`) to view, securely edit, and permanently delete products.
*   **Identity & Registration:** New users can sign up for an account. Credentials are automatically hashed and securely stored using `BCrypt`.
*   **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Fine-grained method-level and URL-level security enforcing strict role-gating (Admin, Staff, Customer).
*   **Dynamic Authentication UI:** A responsive, polished Bootstrap 5 UI that seamlessly adapts the navigation bar and views based on the active user's role and session state.

## Prerequisites

Before running the application, ensure you have the following installed:

*   [Java 17 JDK](https://adoptium.net/) (or a compatible OpenJDK distribution)
*   Maven 3.8+ (optional, the project includes `./mvnw`)
*   PostgreSQL

## How to Run

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/abhishake2323/GamerSupplies.git
    cd GamerSupplies
    ```
2.  **Configure the Database:**
    Create a PostgreSQL database named gamersupplies.
    Update src/main/resources/application.properties with your PostgreSQL username and password.
    The products table and sample data will be created automatically on first run.

3.  **Run the application (Development Mode):**
    The application defaults to an **H2 in-memory database**. This means you do not need to install or configure an external database server to test the application locally. Data will reset upon restart.
    
    Run the application using the Spring Boot Maven plugin:
    ```bash
    mvn spring-boot:run
    ```
    
    The application automatically seeds data using `data.sql`. You can log in using any of the following pre-created accounts (Password for all is `password`):
    - **admin** (`ROLE_ADMIN`)
    - **staff** (`ROLE_STAFF`)
    - **customer** (`ROLE_CUSTOMER`)
    
    *(Alternative)* If `spring-boot:run` fails in your environment, package and run the fat JAR directly:
    ```bash
    mvn clean package -DskipTests
    java -jar target\gamersupplies-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
    ```

4.  **Access the application:**
    *   Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080`.
    *   You can access the H2 DB console at `http://localhost:8080/h2-console` (JDBC URL: `jdbc:h2:mem:gamersuppliesdb`, un/pw: `sa` / `password`).

## Running Tests

The application includes a comprehensive JUnit 5 test suite validating models, MVC controllers, service logic, and database repositories. Run the suite using:
```bash
mvn test
```
